    <p>I'm Rob Smith, an apprentice and degree trained mechanical engineer pivoting my career into full stack development,
         in my previous career I specialised the application of bespoke and off the shelf cutting tools, technical sales across multiple sectors
         and spent time doing business development for a global capital equipment manufacturer.
        
        I'm sure there will be some curiosity around the reason for my career change. The honest reason is that after 16 years
      in the manufacturing industry, I've just decided to start over with something that I am more passionate about, I also
    think that the grounding that manufacuring engineering has given me will make me a well rounded software engineer due to having a
   greater understanding of the software being developed and how it affects customers and end users of the programs being worked on.</p>
